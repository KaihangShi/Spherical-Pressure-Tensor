Source code for:
- Spherical pressure tensor profile calculations: `sphepressIK_pbc_tip4pice_md.f90`
- Planar pressure tensor profile calculations (including all 9 components in the tensor): `planpress_pbc_tip4pice_md_x.f90` (x-axis is vertical to the plane), `planpress_pbc_tip4pice_md_z.f90` (z-axis is vertical to the plane)
- Post-processing of tangential pressure profile that has large fluctuations: `planar_pressure_profile_post_processing.ipynb`

<br/>
All input parameters are set at the beginning of the source code.
